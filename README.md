Facilitates easy updates and feature enhancements.

b)Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968-1969)-The conference aimed to address the "Software Crisis", where software projects frequently failed due to cost overruns, missed deadlines, and poor quality.
2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s)-The adoption of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) revolutionized software development.Languages like C++, Java, and Python introduced principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
3. The Agile Revolution (2001-Present)-Emphasized iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability.
c)List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis-Involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Helps in defining project scope, feasibility, and constraints.
Planning-Includes defining project objectives, timelines, resources, and budgeting.
Helps in risk assessment and choosing the best development approach.
System Design-Focuses on designing software architecture, database structures, UI/UX, and system components.
Ensures that the system meets the specified requirements.
Implementation (Coding)-The actual development phase where programmers write and compile the code.
Uses programming languages, frameworks, and development tools to build the software.
Testing & Integration-Involves checking for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.
Includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Deployment-The software is released to the production environment.
May involve cloud deployment, installation on servers, or distribution to users.
Maintenance & Support-Fixes bugs, updates features, and ensures continuous performance improvements.
Helps in software scalability and long-term usability.

d)Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
When to Use Waterfall vs. Agile
Appropriate Scenarios for Waterfall
Government or Military Projects – Strict regulations require a well-documented and structured approach.
Healthcare Systems – Compliance with industry standards (e.g., FDA, HIPAA) demands detailed planning and minimal changes.
Construction or Manufacturing Software – Engineering-based projects where requirements remain fixed.
Appropriate Scenarios for Agile
Startup Product Development – Frequent changes based on user feedback and market demands.
Mobile App or Web Development – Continuous feature updates and improvements are needed.
E-commerce Platforms – Dynamic market trends require frequent adjustments.

e)Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
. Software Developer
A Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software applications.
Key Responsibilities:

Writing clean, efficient, and scalable code.
Collaborating with designers and other developers to implement software solutions.
Debugging and fixing issues in the code.
Optimizing performance and security of applications.

2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
A QA Engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards through rigorous testing and analysis.
Key Responsibilities:

Designing and executing test plans, cases, and scripts.
Identifying and reporting bugs and performance issues.
Automating tests to improve efficiency.
Ensuring compliance with security and usability standards.

3. Project Manager (PM)
A Project Manager oversees the software development process, ensuring timely delivery within budget and scope.
Key Responsibilities:

Defining project goals, timelines, and deliverables.
Managing communication between stakeholders, developers, and QA teams.
Allocating resources and assigning tasks.
Tracking project progress and mitigating risks.


f)Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's is a software application that provides tools to facilitate coding,debugging and testing in one unified interface
IMPORTANCE:
built in debugging tools to help fix errors and identify them in a structured way
Help optimize and restructure code without altering functionality.
Works with frameworks,compilers and databases for smooth development.
examples of IDE'S: visual studio code, pycharm,eclipse
Version control systems:is a tool that tracks changes to source code over time,enabling collaboration and rollback of modifications.
IMPORTANCE:
Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project without conflicts.
Code History & Rollback: Allows reverting to previous versions if issues arise.
Branching & Merging: Developers can create separate branches for features and merge them once complete.
Backup & Security: Ensures code is safely stored and recoverable.
Code Review & Accountability: Enables peer reviews and tracking of contributions.

g)What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. 
examples of VCS;Git,Mercurial
1.managing complex codebases:as project grows,maintaining it becomes difficult which may lead to bugs.  strategies:folow a modular programming and clean code principles.
2.Debugging and fixing bugs can be difficult and time-consuming. strategies:use debugging tools
3.Meeting tight deadlines:software projects have deadlines that need to be met which leads to stress.strategies;follow an agile methodology for iterative development
4.Effective collaboration in a team:poor communication and misalignment among developers ca slow down projects. strategies;use version control systems like Git for collaboration

h)Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
. Unit Testing
Focuses on testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation.
Conducted by developers using frameworks like JUnit (Java), PyTest (Python), and NUnit (.NET).
Importance:Detects bugs early in development.
. Integration Testing:Tests how multiple units or modules interact with each other.
Ensures that data flow and communication between integrated components work correctly.
Importance:Identifies issues in module interaction.
. System Testing:Validates the complete software system as a whole against requirements.
Performed in an environment that mimics real-world conditions.
Importance:Ensures the entire application works as intended.
4. Acceptance Testing:Determines if the software meets business and user requirements.
Typically conducted by end-users or clients before final deployment.
Importance:
Ensures the system is ready for production
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


i)Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting and optimizing input queries (prompts) to achieve the best possible response from an AI model.
IMPORTANCE:
 Improves Response Accuracy:A well-crafted prompt ensures that the AI understands the request correctly, reducing vague or irrelevant answers.
 Enhances AI Efficiency:Reduces the need for multiple follow-up queries by making the request clear and precise from the start.
 Enables Customization and Control:Users can structure prompts to generate outputs in specific formats (e.g., summaries, bullet points, code snippets).

j)Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt:Tell me about fashion.
Improved prompt:Summarize the top fashion trends in the 1990's,focusing on popular colors and emerging fashions.
